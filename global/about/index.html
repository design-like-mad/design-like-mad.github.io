            <h2>A Message from Abby Larner</h2>
            <p>Hi Everyone!  My name is Abby, and I'm a UX Designer based out of Madison, Wisconsin.  In 2011 I graduated from the University of Virginia with a degree in Environmental Science, but a passion for design. Despite my lack of design training, I was determined to immerse myself in the great field of design.</p>
            <p>Over the past 3 years, not only have I been heavily involved in design and front-end development, but I have also been engaged in the Madison start up community.  I started to realize that the development and start up communities are strongly collaborative, but for some reason the design community is more fragmented.  This is where the idea of Design Like Mad came from.</p>
            <p>I saw a need for a space where designers could collaborate with others, learn from eachother, and experience a variety of different types of design.  Design Like Mad accomplishes these goals. I hope that Design Like Mad continues to grow.  It's truly amazing what happens when so much talent rallies together to help our communities.</p>
